# Classifying fraudulent credit card transactions
### Data Science Project 3, Siddharth Garimella

With a particularly high volume of credit card transactions taking place on a daily basis, credit card companies must rely on techniques from statistics to identify potentially fraudulent transactions early on. As there is often no one feature of a transaction that can be used to mark the transaction as fraudulent, machine learning techniques can help uncover which features of a transaction matter most to this classification.

For developing a model to classify transactions as either safe or fraudulent, a dataset containing transactions made by European cardholders over two days in September 2013 will be used. The dataset was collected during a research collaboration of Worldline and a group at Universite Libre de Bruxelles on big data mining and fraud detection. You can read more about it on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

Some ethical concerns include violating the terms of misuse (defined [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)) and applying a model that discriminates between transactions based on factors that could put certain groups of users at an unfair disadvantage.
