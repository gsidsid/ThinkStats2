### Data driven heart disease prediction
Siddharth Garimella

Using data from the Cleveland Heart Disease database, I identified, tuned, and validated a variety of machine learning models to
predict the likelihood a patient has heart disease given some medical information. After searching for and using the combinations 
of parameters that allow each model to score best, I selected the highest scorers for calibration. In this step, I 
investigated the distributions of probability scores output by each model, and attempted to make each model less certain in the 
probabilities it outputs. In practice, this didn't work well, and I provide my reasoning for why this may be the case.
