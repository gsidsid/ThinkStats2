### Finding differences between Conservatives and Liberals
#### Siddharth Garimella


I looked through data from the General Social Survey (GSS) to gain a better understanding about what issues conservatives and liberals differ most on. After making some guesses of my own, I separated conservative and liberal respondents, and sorted their effect sizes for every variable in the dataset segment I had available, ultimately finding three big differences between the two groups. My results suggest conservatives disagree more with same-sex relationships, tend to be slightly older, and attend religious events far more often than liberals. 

It is possible the GSS contains variables with higher effect sizes that also deserve to be on this list, but accurately conducting an analysis of the entire dataset requires finding and removing codewords from every column, which is particularly time-intensive. The three differences described above are a result of first finding the maximum effect sizes of the variables without the codewords removed, in an attempt to make an initial guess.
