# Trends in student mental health in the last decade
### Siddharth Garimella


I plan on working with the general social survey data and any other datasets made available to me via heri.ucla.edu. Much data is already collected for me, and available online. The data is avaliable for disclosure, but should probably not be used to attempt to affect or otherwise impact present student mental health in any way.

# Questions to explore

1. How have students' opinions of their mental health changed over the past decade?
2. Which age group is most responsible for a change, if any, in this sentiment?
