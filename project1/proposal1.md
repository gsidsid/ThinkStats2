# What values do self-identifying conservatives and liberals differ on most?
### Data Science Project 1, Siddharth Garimella

In a US Government class I took in high school, one of the first concepts my professor tried to teach the class was the faultiness/inaccuracy of the distinction between a "liberal" and a "conservative". These terms are often used loosely, and tend to be associated with slightly different sets of values and ideals for different people. For the purposes of media, the two groups have been pit against each other as if the ideals/values of each group are in complete opposition to each other, and it is likely this process has created broader misconceptions pertaining to each group.

I want to use the data science techniques taught thus far to attempt to gain a better understanding of how much specific values/views contribute to people's political identifications on the "liberal"-"conservative" spectrum.

Some potential ethical issues of this analysis include incendiary conclusion framing and taking a side inadvertently during the analysis conducted.
