# Estimating the impact of negative Yelp reviews using business closures
Siddharth Garimella

I grew up in a neighborhood in which quite a few businesses came and went in the blink of an eye.
Either they resonated with nearby residents, joining a select few other local mainstays, or they would swiftly be forced to close.

With the advent of online rating platforms such as Yelp, however, I believe 
the margin of error for many small businesses has decreased even further. Yelp 
is becoming an increasingly popular platform for prospective consumers to choose
where to spend their money, and it is more and more important for many new businesses
on Yelp to maintain a good average rating.

But what happens when the ratings are bad? 
Do bad average ratings early on in a company's Yelp page deter customers enough 
to make a measurable financial impact on the business? To answer these questions, 
I'm going to run a Survival Analysis using the Yelp academic dataset (easily downloaded 
from Kaggle's website, contains information about > 100k stores), and measure the times 
from the first Yelp review made for a store to the store's closure (if the store is closed).
