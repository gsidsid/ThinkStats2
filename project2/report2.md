# Estimating the impact of negative Yelp reviews using business closures
Siddharth Garimella

I grew up in a neighborhood in which quite a few businesses came and went in the blink of an eye.
Either they resonated with nearby residents, joining a select few other local mainstays, or they would swiftly be forced to close.

With the advent of online rating platforms such as Yelp, however, I believe 
the margin of error for many small businesses has decreased even further. Yelp 
is becoming an increasingly popular platform for prospective consumers to choose
where to spend their money, and it is more and more important for many new businesses
on Yelp to maintain a good average rating.

But what happens when the ratings go bad? 
Do bad average ratings early on in a company's Yelp page deter customers enough 
to make a measurable financial impact on the business? To answer these questions, 
I run a Survival Analysis using the Yelp Academic dataset for different average ratings
on Yelp, and compare the output to find the difference in probabilities in closure 
at certain times in a business's "lifespan".


### About the Yelp Academic dataset

The Yelp Academic dataset is a subset of Yelp's businesses, reviews, and user data. It was originally put together for the Yelp Dataset Challenge on Kaggle, which was a chance for students to conduct research or analysis on Yelp's data and share their discoveries. The dataset contains information about 174,000 businesses across 11 metropolitan areas in four countries. For these businesses, 5.2 million reviews are provided, complete with the review text, date, and rating in stars.
