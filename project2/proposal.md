# Measuring the impact Yelp reviews have on small businesses
### Data Science Project 2, Siddharth Garimella
I grew up in a neighborhood in which quite a few businesses came and went in the blink of an eye. Either they resonated with nearby residents, joining a select few other local mainstays, or they would swiftly be forced to close. 
With the advent of online rating platforms such as Yelp, however, I believe the margin of error for many small businesses has decreased even further. Yelp is becoming an increasingly popular platform for prospective consumers to choose where to spend their money, and it is more and more important for many new businesses on Yelp to maintain a good average rating. 
But what happens when the ratings are bad? Do bad average ratings early on in a company's Yelp page deter customers enough to make a measurable financial impact on the business? To answer these questions, I'm going to run a Survival Analysis using the Yelp academic dataset (contains information about > 100k stores), and measure the times from the first Yelp review made for a store to the store's closure (if the store is closed). 
Some ethical concerns regarding this project could involve using information from this project to generate some specific number of fake reviews for a store's Yelp account, thus affecting its business prospects. There is also a terms of use for this dataset published on Kaggle, which also describes a variety of ways this data can be misused.
